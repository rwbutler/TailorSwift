## Requirements

## Installation
### Cocoapods

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager which integrates dependencies into your Xcode workspace. To install it using [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) run:

```
gem install cocoapods
```

To install TailorSwift using Cocoapods, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```
pod "TailorSwift"
```

Then run the command:

```
pod install
```

For more information [see here](https://cocoapods.org/#getstarted).

### Carthage

Carthage is a dependency manager which produces a binary for manual integration into your project. It can be installed via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using the commands:

```
brew update
brew install carthage
```

In order to integrate TailorSwift into your project via Carthage, add the following line to your project's Cartfile:

```
github "rwbutler/TailorSwift"
```

From the macOS Terminal run `carthage update --platform iOS` to build the framework then drag `TailorSwift.framework` into your Xcode project.
