* CollectionAdditions - Map directly to an array of distinct elements instead of converting to an intermediate Set.
* DictionaryAdditions - Instantiate a Swift dictionary from an array of tuples.
* UIColorAdditions - UIColor extension for getting a lighter / darker shade of a given colour. [Details](https://medium.com/@rwbutler/uicolor-extension-for-getting-a-lighter-darker-shade-of-a-given-colour-b1a57931f730)
